This repository highlights my hands-on experience in Search Engine Optimization (SEO), covering both on-page and off-page strategies, along with local business directory and citation management. The work focuses on improving organic visibility, search rankings, and targeted traffic for service-based and local businesses.

I’ve performed keyword research and SEO strategy planning to identify high-intent search terms aligned with user behavior and business goals. Based on search intent, I optimized website content, meta titles, descriptions, and heading structures to improve relevance, engagement, and click-through rates.

The repository also reflects my experience in conducting full website SEO audits, identifying technical, on-page, and performance issues, and implementing improvements to enhance crawlability and overall site health.

On the off-page side, I worked on link-building initiatives through social bookmarking and high-quality directory submissions to strengthen traffic. As part of a freelancing project, I managed business directories and local citations, ensuring accurate keyword-optimized profiles, and consistent branding across multiple platforms.
